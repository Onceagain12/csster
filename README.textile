Small libary to generate CSS style rules within Javascript.

h2. Usage



h2. Motivation

This project comes from my frustration of trying to build standalone Javascript widgets. Web
projects always involve the combination of HTML DOM, CSS and Javascript. It's often simpler to
generate the necessary DOM within your Javascript, removing any coupling (and a simpler calling
convention) to a specific web page. But most widgets have certain style rules. To avoid
any coupling with the CSS at all, styles can be included inline, but these gets bulky 
and hard to read. The "rule" nature of CSS is nice. So widgets then have a Javascript
and CSS component. Wouldn't it be nice, though, to remove that CSS component. 

With the advent of SASS, the coupling is even more complicated, as now there's some other
tool completely unrelated to your component, written in some other language. Wouldn't
a unified approach be nice?
